# 🧮 Web Calculator

A fully functional, responsive Calculator web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It features a modern dark-themed UI, handles basic arithmetic operations, and includes full keyboard support for desktop users.

## ✨ Features

* **Arithmetic Operations:** Supports Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`), and Modulus (`%`).
* **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout that adjusts for mobile devices (max-width: 500px).
* **Dark Mode UI:** sleek black and orange color scheme for reduced eye strain.
* **Error Handling:** Detects invalid syntax (e.g., starting with an operator) and displays "Syntax Error".
* **Keyboard Support:** fully mapped keyboard events for faster input.

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

You can use your physical keyboard to interact with the calculator:

| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `0-9` | Input Numbers |
| `+` `-` `*` `/` `%` | Operators |
| `Enter` | Calculate Total (`=`) |
| `Backspace` | Delete last digit (`⌫`) |
| `Escape` | All Clear (`AC`) |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure of the application.
* **CSS3:** Styling using CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Logic for calculation, DOM manipulation, and event listeners.
